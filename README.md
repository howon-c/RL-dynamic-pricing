# RL_pricing
This is a repository for the paper "[Scalable reinforcement learning approaches for dynamic pricing in ride-hailing systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019126152300173X)".

Simplified pricing example:
To quickly experiment with RL methods, run `python simple_train.py --algo TD3 --timesteps 10000`.\nAlgorithms TD3, PPO and SAC from Stable-Baselines3 are supported.
